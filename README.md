CAS2-the Web Platform for Interaction Designers  Fabio Franchino (2 ECTS)  
================

The documentation of the students' projects developed during the course Web Platform for Interaction Designers

**Description**
The Web Platform is playing a fundamental role in the digital world, providing a deviceagnostic
set of tools that allow the development of interactive software for a variety of digital
endpoints.
After two decades of evolution alongside the Webâ€™s progresses, today designers and
developers can work with a mature platform that is fluid by design and supports unprecedented
and novel ways to craft interactive user interfaces.
The course will focus on the main Web Platform technologies, in order to provide a
basis to the building of interactive UI prototypes.  

**Objectives**
Design topics like page layout, typography, simple navigation, interactivity and animation
will be covered through the combined use of the latest versions of HTML, SVG, CSS and Javascript
technologies. An overview of the basic mobile hardware functionalities provided by
the Phonegap framework will be given.
Students will learn how to sketch user interfaces within a browser, which allows fastpaced
iterations of the creative process as well as testing the experience directly on the target
device.
Furthermore, students will be encouraged to discover and use solutions already provided
by the web community.  

**Examination**
Student evaluation will be based on project presentation, from concept idea to final implementation,
passing through the iterative prototyping phase.
In order to be admitted to the examination, students must deliver the documentation
and communication materials according to the documentation guidelines (see Guidelines
for documentation booklet) within the appropriate deadline.
